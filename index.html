        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Taking up photography in and around 2020, I begun taking photos of Sullivan Heights Middle School and West Ridge High School concert and marching bands. In 2024, I decided to branch out and started taking photos of live bands in Kingsport and Johnson City. This website is housing some of the photos taken within the dates mentioned. I have enjoyed getting to meet the local artists and business owners. My current pursuit encompasses promoting local businesses, artists, and venues and push the boundries of my newly found interest in photography. I started housing my photos in Instagram @fstop_ginger and am now trying working to creating my own website as an alternate way to present my work. This sight is currenly under construction and as I beging to learn coding, I hope in the future to have a site that can be an alternate vehicle for my photography.</p>
